h2(#honk-install). Requirements, install & setup

You'll need "Sinatra":http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra and, optionnaly,
"Thor":http://github.com/wycats/thor and a formatter such as RedCloth, 
Maruku,...

Thor is used for convenience scripts (regenerating the taglist, managing your
posts) so I strongly recommend that you install it. The formatter may be used to
ease the editing of your posts. Honk will treat the contents as raw HTML if you
don't specify a formatter (see below).

Once you've got this, clone this repository or grab a tarball and extract it
where you want to install your blog. Run @ruby honk.rb@ or @thor honk:start@ to
start your blog.

h2(#honk-usage). Usage 

Honk relies on two main files, plus your posts and the comments for your posts,
which will be automatically generated.

h3. Index

The @index.yml@ files contains a sequence of mappings in which each key is a
short name for your post, and the value is the path for your post (relative to
Honk's root) or @nil@ to automatically build the path.

<pre><code>
  --- !honk.yapok.org,2009/Index
  - my_first_post: my_first_post.yml
  - another_one: another_one.yml
  - alias: this_post_is_aliased.yml
  - magic: ~ # will map to magic.yml
</code></pre>

The way Honk works allows you to write posts without publishing them. They will
be available only when you add them to the index. Be careful that it is a
sequence, which mean it's ordered: the most recent posts go at the bottom of
this file.

h3. Tags

Next, the @tags.yml@ file is a more complicated one with two mappings: one that
maps your different tags to your posts, and one that do the opposite. Thus, the
file maybe a little be difficult to manage without screwing everything up, so I
strongly advise you to use the Thor commands to manage your tags.

Here's an example @tags.yml@

<pre><code>
  --- !honk.yapok.org,2009/TagsPerPost
  a_post:
    - a_tag
    - another_one
  --- !honk.yapok.org,2009/PostsPerTag
  a_tag:
    - a_post
  another_one:
    - a_post
</code></pre>
